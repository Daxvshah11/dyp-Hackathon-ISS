We have kept the basic concept of our website very much scalable.

For now, under the strict contraints of time, we have assumed that the website is being used by a group of only 10 fixed people

Also, no new groups can be created for now for the same reasons. 

Although, as many new transaction entries for payment splits can be be created under this group as required.

With the help of the simple yet smart & scalabe design of the website, we can add a lot many additional & useful features to the website with enough time in hands 

Some of them are as mentioned below:

	-> date-wise filter

	-> creating newer groups with newer possible members
	
	-> adding a payment option using links of other payment apps
	
	-> inserting better visualizations
